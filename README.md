Wow, just walked out of the theater and still reeling from The Monkey. Man, it was like... how do I even... okay, so, imagine if you just mixed up a circus, a philosophy class, and a really confusing dream about tacos you ate once. That's...kind of what it felt like.

The popcorn was stale but the whole movie... it was like, idk, sometimes harsh, sometimes hilarious, like watching a monkey try to solve a Rubik's cube with gloves made of marshmallows. The theater itself was loud, you know, with all those usual background noises. People were coughing more than an old school typewriter playing bad jazz. My back is killing me, chairs are less comfortable than those medieval torture devices.

> And this one scene, oh boy, the monkey was just staring intensely at nothingness. I swear it was like looking at a mirror when you're too tired to focus on anything but just being alive. The monkey's eyes... you could see universes being born and destroyed in slow motion. Or maybe I just need more sleep.

Someone in the front row dropped their phone like three times, sounded like an earthquake every time. And oh! That scene with the banana and the saxophone? I still can't figure out if it was brilliant or just batshit crazy. 

Ok, so, you gotta download the movie, man, or, I mean maybe just watch the movie if you're into visual haikus wrapped in chaotic energy. Was I supposed to understand the ending...? Ugh, what was the deal with that? Felt like watching my dreams get rewritten by a hyperactive squirrel with too much caffeine.

I think I spilled popcorn in my hair—who even does that?! Need to shower like a tired bear in spring.

int banana(float rhythm) {  
    return rhythm  (int)Math.Floor(monkeyBananaSax);
}  

Was that code from somewhere else?? Anyway, mind is a whirlwind. I should find a taco truck or something...
